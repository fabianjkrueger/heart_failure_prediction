    "It is well documented, available for public use, and well suited for a data science project including EDA, some nice visualisations and predictive modeling. In addition to that, it fits my background in biomedical research, and might help raising awareness to this topic, since cardiovascular diseases are the currently the most common cause of death world wide.\n",

    "## What's next?\n",
    "In this notebook, I will take perform an EDA to take an even closer look at the dataset. Among other things, I will inspect its features, look for some potential correlations or other underlying properties and create some (hopefully) beautiful visualistions."

    "### Getting an Overview\n",
    "This is done to get an overview of all that's available in the dataset. Without properly understanding your source data, it's impossible to make use of it. This included inspecting data types, distributions and making visualisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "This dataset was acquired from Kaggle. It is already structured and cleaned. It is rather unlikely that there are even missing values in it. Still, it needs to be checked, since the algorithms I aim to make use of, cannot handle missing values, and in case there are some, they need to be handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "FIXME: This is often seen as a part of feature engineering (together with feature extraction). Still need to decide if I include it here or in another notebook. Also, data cleaning and handling missing values can be seen as feature engineering. Think about if this notebook should be renamed to \"EDA and Feature Engineering\" or something similar to that, and if I should include the remaining parts of feature engineering here or not. Before, I had planned to perform feature extraction in a separate notebook, and I actually still think that this is a good idea.â€š\n",
    "\n",
    "One main challenges to overcome in machine learning projects is to select relevant features for training the algorithms. Your model can always only be as good as the underlying data used to train it. You cannot out-train bad data. It is your job to select relevant features and to sort out irrelevant ones in order to ensure usefulness of your model.\n",

    "- Are there missing values? If yes, what to do with them?\n"
