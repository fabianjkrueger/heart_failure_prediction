    "It is well documented, available for public use, and well suited for a data science project including EDA, some nice visualisations and predictive modeling. In addition to that, it fits my background in biomedical research, and might help raising awareness to this topic, since cardiovascular diseases are the currently the most common cause of death world wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's next?\n",
    "In this notebook, I will take perform an EDA to take an even closer look at the dataset. Among other things, I will inspect its features, look for some potential correlations or other underlying properties and create some (hopefully) beautiful visualistions."
