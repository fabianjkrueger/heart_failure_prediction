# README
This directory contains all data used in this project. In order to save storage, it is currently contained in the .gitignore and not pushed to GitHub. The notebooks (or scripts) contain all the sources code used to acquire and process the data. The cells put out the steps necessary to understand all actions and align them in a meaningful narrative. Further information can be found in the READMEs and the blog post. If you want to replicate this, just run the code. If you run into issues and need the data to be provided to you, just reach out to me.
