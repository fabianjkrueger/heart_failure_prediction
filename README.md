# Machine Learning Portfolio Project

In the following weeks, I will complete another machine learning project here.

## Current Stage: Ideation
Look at the big picture, make a plan, define a goal or question to solve and measure of success.
Have a look at publicly available data sets and see what can be done with them.


## Next Stage: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Transformation, Feature Engineering
