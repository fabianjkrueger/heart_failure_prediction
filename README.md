# Machine Learning Portfolio Project

In the following weeks, I will complete another machine learning project here.

Right now, this is still work in progress.

## Current Stage: Ideation
Set up infrastructure like a directory structure that aligns with best practices. Already prepare things like virtual environment and documentation etc.

Look at the big picture, make a plan, define a goal or question to solve and measure of success.
Have a look at publicly available data sets and see what can be done with them.

## Next Stage: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Transformation, Feature Engineering
