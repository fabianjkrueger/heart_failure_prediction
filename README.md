# Machine Learning Portfolio Project

I currently complete another machine learning project here.

Right now, this is still work in progress.

My plan is to fit a simple model to heart failure data from Kaggle and to predict patient survival.

## Current Stage: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Can be found in [02-exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb](02-exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb).

## Next Stage: Data Cleaning, Transformation, Feature Engineering

Optimize features for training a model.

## Further Stages and Milestones
- Model Training
- Evaluation
- Potentially deployment (depending of if this makes any sense for this project)
- Final documentation (blog post)

# Sources
A quick overview of the main sources I used while working on this project.

## Data
Raw data is a dataset about heart failure and patient survival from a study by Chicco et al., I acquired from Kaggle.

Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Jurman: Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 20, 16 (2020)

## Concepts, Techniques and Inspiration
FIXME: Transform this list of bullet points to a proper resource.
- I got a lot of inspiration and knowledge from Aurélien Géron's book Hands-On ML (insert citation here, can be found in book)
- Countless websites for tutorials (cannot all be mentioned, but most relevant ones are mentioned or linked in the notebooks when they are used)
- The Data Camp Podcast with Nick Singh: How to build a DS portfolio

## Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Kaggle
