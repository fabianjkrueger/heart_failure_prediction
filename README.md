# Machine Learning Portfolio Project

I currently complete another machine learning project here.

Right now, this is still work in progress.

My plan is to fit a simple model to heart failure data from Kaggle and to predict patient survival.

## Current Stage: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Can be found in `notebooks/02-exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`.

## Next Stage: Data Cleaning, Transformation, Feature Engineering

Optimize features for training a model.

## Further Stages and Milestones
- Model Training
- Evaluation
- Potentially deployment (depending of if this makes any sense for this project)
- Final documentation (blog post)
