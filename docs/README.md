# Documentation Of What I Did

## Set Up the Repo
I set up the repo so that it is public, I am the only contributor, main branch is protected, but I can (due to being the only contributor) merge without approval. I set up a personal access token for my local machine. I will work in feature branches. This, for example, is done in the "documentatio" branch.
I should probably rename this file so it is not the README for this directory, but right now, it does not matter. I am still very early in the project.

## Ideation
Now I begin to ideate milestones and a general plan with stages. I set the stages/milestones as issues. Not complete or comprehensive right now, since the project is going to evolve.

Main onjective right now: Frame the plan. I need to find an interesting research question or project idea to solve and with it a data set allowing to do so. I could also go the other way round and look for data sets, then see what I can do with them. I want to do data cleaning, visualisations and finally some predictive modelling using Scikit-learn.
