## Set Up the Repo
I set up the repo so that it is public, I am the only contributor, main branch is protected, but I can (due to being the only contributor) merge without approval. I set up a personal access token for my local machine. I will work in feature branches. This, for example, is done in the "documentation" branch.

In past projects, I had suboptimal directory structures. While I improved over the time, I still think there is a lot of room for improvements. I finally want to move to best practices and adapt a standardized and generic approach that is logical and easy to understand for others. I found two very reasonable approaches that resemble another strongly. 

1. Use Cookie Cutter. This automatically set up a directory structure for you that fulfills all criteria mentioned above and more. This is a well thought through function and the structure is great. However, I will not use it for this project. Since this is the first time I will use standardize directories like src, docs, notebooks etc., I want to set them up manually to get a better understanding of why they are used. Furthermore, I feel like Cookie Cutter could be slightly overkill for my first project. I will not need all of its directories.
2. Set it up yourself, but stickt to established structures. There are some great resources out there, including the Cookie Cutter docs and many others, that explain all directories and how to set up a logical structure. They usually slightly differ from another. However, that is fine, because while sticking to the general framework, it is crucial to adapt the details to the current situation.

Conclusion: I will set up the directory structure manually this time and hope to use Cookie Cutter in my next or one of my future projects.

## Ideation
Now I begin to ideate milestones and a general plan with stages. I set the stages/milestones as issues. Not complete or comprehensive right now, since the project is going to evolve.

Main onjective right now: Frame the plan. I need to find an interesting research question or project idea to solve and with it a data set allowing to do so. I could also go the other way round and look for data sets, then see what I can do with them. I want to do data cleaning, visualisations and finally some predictive modelling using Scikit-learn.
